<p>The sun-birds bear a similar relation
to the oriental tropics that the humming
birds do to the warmer regions of the
Western hemisphere. Both have a remarkably
brilliant plumage which is in
harmony with the gorgeous flowers that
grow in the tropical fields. It is probable
that natives of Asia first gave the
name sun-birds to these bright creatures
because of their splendid and shining
plumage. By the Anglo-Indians they
have been called hummingbirds, but
they are perching birds while the hummingbirds
are not. There are over one
hundred species of these birds. They are
graceful in all their motions and very
active in their habits. Like the hummingbirds,
they flit from flower to
flower, feeding on the minute insects
which are attracted by the nectar, and
probably to some extent on the honey,
for their tongues are fitted for gathering
it. However, their habit while gathering
food is unlike that of the hummingbird,
for they do not hover over the flower,
but perch upon it while feeding. The
plumage of the males nearly always differs
very strongly from that of the females.
The brilliantly colored patches
are unlike those of the hummingbirds
for they blend gradually and are not
sharply contrasted, though the iridescent
character is just as marked. The
bills are long and slender, finely pointed
and curved. The edges of the mandibles
are finely serrated.</p>
<p>The nests are beautiful structures suspended
from the end of a bough or even
from the underside of a leaf. The entrance
is near the top and usually on the
side. Over the entrance a projecting
portico is often constructed. The outside
of the nest is usually covered with coarse
materials, apparently to give the effect
of a pile of rubbish. Two eggs are
usually laid in these cozy homes, but in
rare instances three have been found.
The Philippine Sun-bird of our illustration
is a native of the Philippines and is
found on nearly all the islands from
Luzon to Mindanao. The throat of the
male has a beautiful iridescence shaded
with green, while that of the female,
shown on the nest, is yellow.</p>

<h2 id="c4">THE ANIMALS&rsquo; FAIR.
<br /><span class="small">PART II&mdash;THE FAIR.</span></h2>
<p>Days and weeks of busy preparation
rolled around and promptly at the appointed
time the Animals&rsquo; Fair opened
in splendor.</p>
<p>A large football field had been secured
for the show, and a striking sight met
the eyes of curious men, women and
children, who crowded through the gates
on the opening day.</p>
<p>Two immense St. Bernard dogs had
been appointed gatekeepers, and the human
crowd were uncommonly respectful
and subdued as they paid their entrance
fee of a handful of grain or a juicy bone
and passed these representatives of animal
law.</p>
<p>The first thing to attract the eye as
one entered the Fair was a large band
stand which was occupied by a band of
monkeys in red coats and caps, who
made up in quantity what their music
lacked in quality, and went through their
performance with a decorum unexcelled
by more musical organizations.</p>
<p>The monkeys found themselves more at
home in their booth, which, was near
the grand stand, the entrance fee to
which was a small sack of peanuts. Here
the delighted human audience watched
an unequaled show of daring rope and
trapeze performances, of acrobatic feats
which none but &ldquo;four-handed&rdquo; artists
were able to accomplish, and of comical
antics such as only monkeys can go
through. The excited children screamed
with laughter and showered peanuts
upon the performers, who, following
their instincts, forgot their scheduled
program and joined in a wild rush and
squabble over the unexpected treat. Such
little episodes were soon over, however,
and the entertainment and forgotten dignity
were resumed together.</p>
<p>Next to the monkeys&rsquo; booth was one
occupied by geese, ducks and peacocks,
and was one which deserves especial
mention. It was elaborately decorated
with garlands of feather flowers dyed in
all the colors of the rainbow, hung
against a background of snowy white
feathers. On each side stood a peacock
with gorgeous tail outspread, showing to
lovely effect against the white walls behind
them. Pillows and cushions of
softest feathers, festoons of snowy down
trimmings, quills and wings and breasts
for millinery purposes, feather boas,
feather brushes and dusters, quill pens
and quill toothpicks were displayed to
greatest advantage and offered for sale
for a small sum of wheat or corn.</p>
<p>The hogs came next with a large and
elaborate display, which included strings
of sausages and Dewey hams, huge glass
jars of snowy lard, hams and bacon put
up in fancy ways, and piles of canned
pork and deviled ham. In another part
of the booth were brushes of all kinds
made from hog bristles, soaps manufactured
from otherwise unsalable parts of
hog anatomy, saddles and other leather
goods made from the hides, and&mdash;in a
conspicuous position&mdash;a great pile of inflated
pigskin footballs, which caught the
eye of every schoolboy who came near
the booth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; grunted one of the
boothkeepers to a boy who was examining
this pile of balls, &ldquo;young man,
never despise a hog nor deride him for
his slowness. There is nothing more
lively than a pigskin when properly inflated.
It is a thing for the possession
of which the representatives of the largest
colleges are proud to contend, and
he is the hero of the day who carries
the pigskin to a winning touchdown.
Why, college students will leave their
books behind them, will cast aside the
cultivation of their brains for the glory
of chasing the pigskin over a muddy field.
They will sacrifice life itself in its pursuit
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
and count broken limbs and bloody
noses as badges of honor. Take my advice.
Buy a pigskin football and enter
at once upon the path of glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to add that this
sale, and many like it, were made during
the progress of the Fair.</p>
<p>The booth of the wild birds was the
most beautiful one in the whole display.
It was gotten up to represent a forest
glade, with shadowy aisles and leafy retreats.
Its carpet was made of grasses
and moss and ferns and flowers. A little
fountain cast its waters into a tiny
pool, where birds dipped their wings
or quenched their thirst. Dainty nests
were built in many curious ways, some
hanging from the branches, others hiding
beneath the grasses or sheltered by
the leaves. A myriad of brilliant birds
flitted through this miniature paradise,
the bluebird, the redbird, the orange and
black oriole, the scarlet tanager, golden
canaries and many others, making up a
flashing bouquet of color.</p>
<p>Then there were solos, and duets, and
grand concerts, when thrush and lark
and canary and redbird and warbler
joined their voices in a great gush of
melody through which ran the liquid
trills and cadenzas of mocking-bird and
nightingale. The quail piped his &ldquo;Bob
White&rdquo; from the ferns and grasses; and
the parrot&mdash;as clown of the occasion&mdash;imitated
the human voice in comically
jerky efforts.</p>
<p>Along the front of the booth were displayed
rows of bottles filled with every
imaginable kind of bug and worm which
the industrious birds had gathered from
orchards and fields, and which were exhibited
as proof of the invaluable aid
which the birds give to man.</p>
<p>The cattle display was next on the
list&mdash;a notable one, and attractive to every
man and woman. There were noble
representatives from every breed of cattle,
with the most beautiful, gentle-eyed
calves that were ever seen. There was a
tempting display of great glass jars of
rich milk and yellow cream, huge cheeses
and golden butter balls, daintily molded
curds and glasses of whey. There was
a free tank of delicious iced buttermilk,
which was continually surrounded by a
thirsty crowd who drank as if they had
never tasted buttermilk before.</p>
<p>Then there were countless varieties of
fancy articles made from horn and bone,
pots of glue, cans of neatsfoot oil, and
leather goods of every possible description.</p>
<p>There was dressed beef, and jerked
beef, and dried beef, and potted and
canned and corned and deviled and
roasted. There was oxtail soup, and
blood pudding, and cakes of suet, and
stacks of tallow candles. There were
hides tanned into soft carriage robes and
rugs; there were bottles of rennet tablets;
there were fancy colored bladders,
and bunches of shoestrings. In short,
the articles contained in this display
were beyond enumeration in a short account
like this.</p>
<p>The dogs came next with a wonderful
display of fancy breeds, of trick dogs
and trained dogs, of dogs little and big,
varying from the shaggy Eskimo to the
skinny little hairless Mexican, and from
the huge St. Bernard to the tiny terrier.
The Newfoundlands gave a life-saving
exhibition every day, wherein monkeys
dressed as people were rescued from the
water or from buildings supposed to be
on fire.</p>
<p>The St. Bernards dragged frozen traveler
monkeys from snowbanks of cotton
and carried them on their backs to
places of safety.</p>
<p>Cute puppies and clumsy puppies went
through their antics for the amusement
of the children and rolled unconcernedly
over beautiful carriage rugs which
were labeled &ldquo;Japanese Wolfskin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sheep and goats had a booth together,
wherein was a marvelous display
of wools and woolen goods, yarns,
pelts, angora furs, kid gloves, kid shoes,
rugs, carpets and blankets.</p>
<p>There were ropes of goats&rsquo; hair which
water could not destroy, and wigs which
were destined to cover the heads of
learned judges and barristers.</p>
<p>There was a wonderful red tally-ho
coach, drawn by four snow-white goats
driven by a monkey dressed as a coachman,
which made the circuit of the Fair
grounds every afternoon, while monkey
passengers made the air lively and
cleared the way by the loud notes of
their tin horns. This exhibition set the
children wild, and parents were daily
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
teased to buy the charming turnout for
the use of their little human monkeys.</p>
<p>The cats had a display which met with
the highest favor from their little girl
visitors. Here were beautiful pussies of
every kind and color, with coats as soft
and shiny as silk. There were numbers
of the cunningest kittens, which rolled
and tumbled and went through their most
graceful motions to the unending delight
of the little spectators.</p>
<p>This booth was gaily festooned with
strings of mice and rats, caught up here
and there by small rabbits, gophers and
moles.</p>
<p>There was a string band that played in
this booth every afternoon to demonstrate
the superiority of cat-gut strings over
those made of silk or wire, as used on
violins, mandolins, guitars and all other
stringed instruments. They never failed
to announce that their bows were strung
with the finest of horsehair which had
been supplied by the horses whose booth
was farther down the grounds.</p>
<p>The horses attracted every eye and
aroused much discussion among the visitors
as to whether horses would ever
be entirely superseded by automobiles
and electric engines.</p>
<p>The children went into ecstacies over
the Shetland ponies, and the ladies declared
the Arabian horses &ldquo;too lovely
for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every boy who visited this booth was
presented with a baseball covered with
the best of horsehide leather.</p>
<p>But time fails me to tell of all the
wonderful things which this Fair presented
to the eyes of admiring men. On
one point only was dissatisfaction expressed
by the visitors&mdash;there was no
Midway. President Monkey, when interviewed
by a representative of the Associated
Press in regard to the omission,
made the following remarkable statement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was not a matter of oversight.
The camel volunteered to bring some of
his Arabs to establish the Streets of
Cairo, and some of the monkeys were
anxious to put in a Gay Paris display.
The lions wished to bring some trained
Wild Men of Borneo for a Hagenbeck
show, and the snakes wanted to do jugglery.
You can see that there was no
lack of what misguided people call &lsquo;attractions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The management discussed the Midway
from every point of view, and decided
that it was entirely too low grade
for a first-class entertainment such as
we desired to make. We felt that it
would only attract a rough class of visitors,
whose presence we did not desire.
And so the unanimous decision was, &lsquo;We
will have a good, clean, respectable
show or we will have no show at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. Say emphatically in your
dispatches that the Midway was intentionally
omitted. Such things may do
for men, but beasts will have none of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Fair was in every way a success,
being carried through without disturbance
of any kind and coming out free
of debt and with much legal tender in
the treasury.</p>
<p>Men were so much impressed by the
obligations which they owed to the animal
world that there was a decided improvement
in their treatment of its various
representatives. While this state of
affairs cannot be expected to last long,
the animals have learned how to arouse
such respect and have decided to make
the Animal Fair an annual attraction.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Through Mossy and viny vistas</p>
<p class="t">Soaked ever with deepest shade,</p>
<p class="t0">Dimly the dull owl stared and stared</p>
<p class="t">From his bosky ambuscade.</p>
<p class="lr">&mdash;James Whitcomb Riley, &ldquo;A Vision of Summer.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The Great Gray or Cinereous Owl is
the largest of the American owls. The
appearance of great size, however, is due
to its thick and fluffy plumage. Its body
is very small being only slightly larger
than those of the barred or hoot owl.
The eggs are also said to be small when
compared with the size of the bird.</p>
<p>The range of this handsome Owl is
practically confined to the most northern
regions of North America, where it
breeds from the latitude of Hudson Bay
northward as far as forests extend. In
the winter it is more or less migratory,
the distance that it travels southward
seeming to depend solely on the severity
of the season. It has been captured in
several of the northern United States,
from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans.
It is related in &ldquo;The Hawks and Owls
of the United States,&rdquo; that &ldquo;Dr. Dall
considers it a stupid bird and states that
sometimes it may be caught in the hands.
Its great predilection for thick woods,
in which it dwells doubtless to the very
limit of trees, prevents it from being an
inhabitant of the barren grounds or other
open country in the north. It is crepuscular
or slightly nocturnal in the southern
parts of its range, but in the high
north it pursues its prey in the daytime.
In the latter region, where the sun never
passes below the horizon in summer, it is
undoubtedly necessity and not choice
that prompts it to be abroad in the daylight.&rdquo;
Its yellow eyes are very small
and would indicate day-hunting proclivities.</p>
<p>Dr. A. K. Fisher states that its &ldquo;food
seems to consist principally of hares,
mice and others of the smaller mammals
as well as small birds.&rdquo; Dr. W. H. Dall
has taken &ldquo;no less than thirteen skulls
and other remains of red-poll linnets
from the crop of a single bird.&rdquo; Specimens
in captivity are reported to have
relished a diet of fish.</p>
<p>Its nest is described as a coarse structure
built in the taller trees and composed
of twigs and lined with moss and
feathers. The note of this great bird is
said to be &ldquo;a tremulous, vibrating sound,
somewhat resembling that of the screech
owl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Great Gray Owl is also known as
the Great Sooty Owl and the Spectral
Owl. Its generic title, Scotiaptex, is
from two Greek words, one meaning
darkness and the other to frighten.</p>
<p>The dignified mien of this great bird
may well have been the inspiration that
caused the poet to say,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Art thou, grave bird! so wondrous wise indeed?</p>
<p class="t">Speak freely, without fear of jest or gibe&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">What is thy moral and religious creed?</p>
<p class="t">And what the metaphysics of thy tribe?</p>

<h2 id="c7">MY SUMMER ACQUAINTANCES.</h2>
<p>I spent last summer in a quiet, old
country place where my only near neighbors
were the birds, rabbits and squirrels,
but I formed many pleasant acquaintances
among these, and the dearest
among them was a pair of little goldfinches
that built their nest in the topmost
bough of a young pear tree that
overshadowed the porch where I spent
a great part of my time.</p>
<p>I did not discover the nest until the
little ones were already hatched. The
early June days had been cloudy and
cool and had kept me shut in, so I did
not have the pleasure of watching my
little neighbors build their home. The
nest was so carefully hidden among the
leafy boughs that no one would have
suspected it was there. My attention
was first arrested to it one morning by
the faint cries of young birds, and on
looking up I saw a little goldfinch
perched on the topmost bough of the
pear tree, bending fondly over what I
knew must be the nest. She lingered but
a moment and then darted away to an
apple tree near by, where I discovered
her mate. He was a tiny little fellow,
not much larger than she, but his jacket
seemed a brighter yellow and his head
and the tips of his wings a glossier black.
They rested a moment, seemingly in
earnest conversation, then both darted
away to a thicket of tall grass and weeds
that grew along the banks of a creek that
ran near by.</p>
<p>It was but a few moments until the
little mother was back again and in her
tiny yellow beak I saw the dainty morsel
she was carrying to the hungry little
family.</p>
<p>All day long, back and forth, from the
nest to the thicket she flew, but the hungry
little ones never seemed to be satisfied.
The father bird did not come very
often, and I wondered if he was spending
his time in idleness or seeking pleasure
for himself, while the poor, little
mother was working so arduously for the
support of the family. But I hardly
think this was the case, for he always
came from this same thicket and they
always seemed confidential and happy.
He would rest himself daintily on some
branch overlooking the nest, and with
many quips and turns watch the mother
as she fed the hungry little ones. Sometimes
he would bring food himself and
then they would fly away together. I
think he was searching for the food and
probably gathering it, for sometimes
Mistress Goldfinch would be gone but
a moment until she would return with
the food.</p>
<p>Every day the same scenes were repeated,
only the cries of the little ones
grew more clamorous, and I could see
their gaping mouths as they stretched
their necks, each one trying to convince
the mother that he was the hungriest
bird in the nest. The little mother was
always patient and loving&mdash;what a lesson
to us who so often chafe and fret
under the petty trials of every day life!
As the days went by the young birds
grew bolder and I could see their little
yellow bodies as they fluttered and pushed
themselves near the edge of the nest,
and I knew that there would soon be an
empty nest in the pear tree.</p>
<p>It was one afternoon, about ten days
after I discovered the nest, that the lessons
in flying began. The father and
mother would fly from the nest to some
twig a few feet from the nest and then
back again, then from twig to twig with
many little chirps as if saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you see how easy it is? All you have
to do is to try.&rdquo; Then the boldest little
fellow would perch himself on the edge
of the nest, flutter his little wings, sit
still for a minute, and then roll back into
the nest as if it was too much for him.
Then the father and mother would repeat
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
the lesson, but all in vain that afternoon,
so they finally gave up and went in
search of food. The next morning the
lessons began in earnest, and then the
bold little youngster, who had made so
many pretentions the afternoon before,
grew bolder and with a nervous little
flutter and a sidewise plunge landed on
a twig some few feet below the nest.
He rested a few moments and then, with
a few encouraging chirps from his parents,
tried it again with better results.
One by one the other timid fledglings
were induced to follow him. There were
many tumbles and falls, but the little
mother was always there to encourage
and help, and by afternoon the little home
was deserted. They staid a few days in
the trees near by and then flew away
to seek new homes, and all that was
left to remind me of the happy family
was the empty nest in the leafy bough.</p>

<h2 id="c8">THE BIRD OF PEACE.</h2>
<p>The dove, bearing an olive branch, is,
in Christian art, an emblem of peace.
The early churches used vessels of precious
metal fashioned in the shape of a
dove in which to place the holy sacrament,
no doubt because the Holy Spirit
descended upon Christ in the form of a
dove.</p>
<p>Noah&rsquo;s dove, of still older fame, was
immortalized as a constellation in the
sky.</p>
<p>The plaintive &ldquo;coo&rdquo; of the dove has
also added to the sentiment about it.
The poets delight to refer to it as a
sorrowful bird. One of them says:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Oft I heard the tender dove</p>
<p class="t0">In fiery woodlands making moan.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The dove, &ldquo;most musical, most melancholy,&rdquo;
is the singer whom the mocking
bird does not attempt to imitate.</p>
<p>There is a Philippine legend that of all
birds only the dove understands the human
tongue. The pigeon tribe is noted
for its friendliness to man&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Of all the feathered race</p>
<p class="t0">Alone it looks unscared on the human face.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The word dove means &ldquo;diver&rdquo; and
refers to the way this bird ducks its
head.</p>
<p>It has purposely designed &ldquo;wing whistles&rdquo;
and often strikes the wings together
when beginning to fly.</p>
<p>The broken wing dodge it often practices
tends to prove that its ancestors
built on the ground.</p>
<p>The nest of the dove has no architectural
beauty and it is not a good housekeeper,
and is something of a gad-about.
Indeed, doves are not so gentle in character
as they are usually portrayed. They
are sometimes impolite to each other and
occasionally indulge in a family &ldquo;scrap.&rdquo;
But as nothing in this world is quite perfect,
the dove with its fine form, and
beautiful quaker-like garb, may be accepted
as one of the most interesting of
our birds.</p>

<h2 id="c9">THE GREEN-CRESTED FLYCATCHER.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Empidonax virescens</i>.)</span></h2>
<p>The Green-crested or Acadian Flycatcher
is a frequent summer resident in
the eastern United States, and through
the valley of the Mississippi river it migrates
as far northward as Manitoba,
where it is said to be quite common.</p>
<p>This bird exhibits no haste in its
northward spring journey, for it is one
of the latest species to arrive on its
breeding grounds in the higher latitudes
and as winter approaches, it leaves the
United States entirely and winters in
Mexico, Central America and northern
South America.</p>
<p>If we would make the acquaintance of
the Green-crested Flycatcher, we must
seek it in woodlands in the vicinity of
some stream or other body of water. Its
favorite haunts are &ldquo;deep, shady, second-growth
hardwood forests, on rather elevated
ground, especially beech woods
with little undergrowth, or bottom lands
not subject to periodical overflow.&rdquo; It
is not an over shy bird, yet it is rather
difficult to find, for its colors are in perfect
harmony with its surroundings as it
passes from tree to tree through the dark
foliage of the lower limbs. So perfect is
this color-harmony that Major Charles
Bendire said, &ldquo;I have several times failed
to detect the bird when I was perfectly
certain it was within twenty feet of me,&rdquo;
and Neltje Blanchan likens its movements
to &ldquo;a leaf that is being blown
about, touched by the sunshine flittering
through the trees, and partly shaded by
the young foliage casting its first shadows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like its sister flycatchers the Green-crested
is not a good natured bird and
will even quarrel with individuals of its
own species. Even its voice is fretful,
especially when from its perch it is waiting
for an insect to pass by. It seldom
perches higher than from fifteen to
twenty feet from the ground, and while
standing constantly twitches its tail and
frequently utters a note that Mr. Chapman
describes as a single spee or peet.</p>
<p>It is a beneficial bird, for its food consists
of insects except in the fall when
it feeds to a limited extent on wild berries.
It will occasionally visit orchards
where it has learned there may be found
a plentiful supply of food to its liking.
When an insect is sighted, like the other
flycatchers, except that it chooses a low
rather than a high perch from which to
watch, it flies outward and with an upward
sweep seldom fails to catch its prey
in its open bill, which is suddenly closed
with a notably loud click that seems like
an expression of satisfaction over the
result of its efforts.</p>
<p>The drooping branches of several
kinds of trees and shrubs are selected by
the Green-crested Flycatchers as suitable
sites for their unpretentious homes. The
nests are semipensil, being attached by
the rim to the fork of a small limb or to
two parallel limbs. They are shallow
and so loosely constructed that frequently
the eggs may be seen from the underside.
As this Flycatcher breeds nearly
throughout its range, the materials used
in the construction of the nests varies
greatly. In southern states where Spanish
moss is common it is one of the chief
constituents of the nest. In more northern
district, stems of plants, small roots
and fibrous materials are used. These
are loosely woven with blades of grass,
dry flowers and the catkins of the willow.
Not infrequently the hanging
catkins, decayed fibres and the loose ends
of stems and blades of grass give an
untidy appearance to the home of this
useful and interesting bird.</p>

<h2 id="c10">CHARACTER IN BIRDS.</h2>
<p>In a delightful article called &ldquo;Character
in Birds,&rdquo; Mr. Torrey gives many
instances of bird traits that show distinct
differences of nature in various
species, and which lead one to recall
others that have fallen under observation.
Mr. Torrey does not mention, for instance,
a peculiarity of the redeyed vireo,
which is as marked as its persistent and
rather tiresome note; that is, its almost
intolerable curiosity and fussiness, qualities
which it carries to such an extreme
that they become absolutely comic. I
think I have never seated myself to
watch the nest of any bird, that a redeyed
vireo has not appeared on the scene
and scolded me; and the moment a bird
utters a cry of alarm a redeyed vireo is
sure to appear with his fretful air of
&ldquo;Oh, dear, what is the matter now?&rdquo;
ready and willing to take a hand in any
rows that may be going and quite sure
to make more fuss than the really
aggrieved party; and oddly enough seeming,
in one instance at least, even to
resent the noise that the troubled bird
was making, for one day when an indigo
bird, that I had tormented by watching
its nest, had chippered and chattered
until he had brought every bird in the
neighborhood to see what was the matter,
a redeyed vireo, after prancing around
for a time, flew at the distracted indigo
bird with a very cross squawk, which said
as plainly as words, &ldquo;Do be quiet, can&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vireo&rsquo;s action in this case was in
marked contrast to that of a thistle bird
which came up warbling and gave me a
careless glance, and then flew away still
singing, but as the noise continued he
came back presently and perching on a
twig above me, bent his bright head to
look at me, saying, &ldquo;swee-et&rdquo; in a long-drawn,
inquiring way, with a little break
in his voice which was singularly endearing,
as are all the ways of these
charming creatures; after inspecting me
again he disappeared, but at a renewed
outcry from the indigo birds he came
warbling back once more. This time he
paid little attention to me, having apparently
satisfied his curiosity on that
point on his former visit; but seeming
to divine that there must be some reason
why the indigo bird should make so
much fuss, he began to examine the
tree which held the nest. Suddenly he
discovered the nest, and after a start
which expressed surprise and interest, he
flew up and hovered over it for an instant
and then flitted away, warbling. Redeyed
vireos seem to be always restless
and irritable, and perfectly sure that you
mean to do them or their nests some
harm, and it is sometimes quite distracting
to go into a certain piece of woods
where they are very plentiful; the moment
you enter it they begin their distressful
&ldquo;please, please,&rdquo; uttered half
pleadingly and half crossly. One is
sure they must be near a vireo&rsquo;s nest,
yet may pass beneath it day after day,
and though looking for it fail to find it, if
there are no young ones, so skillful are
they in concealing their beautiful nests.
These are among the most fascinating
of bird cradles, particularly in this piece
of woods where there are many birch
trees, from which the vireo obtains fine,
silky shreds of the beautifully tinted
bark and weaves into the nest with the
most exquisite effect, giving unusual delicacy
of color and texture. The redeye
has also the most remarkable habit of
arranging the nest so that it shall be
quite hidden by the leaves, often with
one leaf which serves as a roof and protects
the young or eggs from sun and
rain; and if they would only keep quiet
they would usually be quite safe, but instead,
the moment any one appears they
make so much noise that attention is attracted
to them at once, and you begin
naturally to look for the cause. Even
then it may be some time before the nest
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
is discovered, as there are usually only
one or two points from which a view of
it can be obtained and a single leaf will
sometimes quite conceal it. Possibly there
are circumstances in the life of a redeyed
vireo which, if known, would account
for his irritability and egotistical belief
that all eyes are upon him with evil intent;
but our eyes are dull, and one
could wish at times that his trials, whatever
they may be, might sweeten his temper.
I do know, at least, that redeyed
vireos are much tormented by that plague
of bird life, the cowbunting, which delights
in laying her eggs in the redeye&rsquo;s
nest; and nowhere could they be placed
where they would cause more discomfort,
for the vireo&rsquo;s nest is a delicate
structure and none too large for its own
nestlings. I think the cowbird often
injures the nest when she lays her egg,
as she probably gets in and out of it
with more or less haste, being hurried by
the aggrieved owners, for not only do the
young vireos fall out of the nest, but
even the interloping cowbird sometimes
falls out before he is able to fly and meets
his death by a tumble before he is prepared
to leave the nest.</p>
<p>One summer I was watching a hawk&rsquo;s
nest and was always greeted by the angry
cries of the redeyed vireos, who never
ceased to scold at me and the hawk,
and so upset a nervous, but well meaning
at least, flycatcher that it, too, joined in
the abuse. Sometimes when the hawk
flew away the vireos would follow him
for quite a distance through the trees,
scolding in the most dismal manner and
showing little fear of the great, fierce
creature, who they seemed to know
could not catch them among the thick
branches of the trees. But one day I
was amazed to see a redeyed vireo actually
on the lower part of the hawk&rsquo;s nest.
To be sure the hawk was absent, but he
had a swift and silent way of returning
that made it seem a rather dangerous
bit of bravado. The redeye often has
a most uncomfortable habit not only of
quarreling with any neighbor that will
quarrel but also of squabbling with each
other even during the time that they are
engaged in caring for the young. One
summer a pair of them, having a nest
in a tree near the house, were so quarrelsome
and kept up such a persistent
clatter that they became really tiresome.
It must be admitted, however, that in
this particular case they had cause for
being irritable, for they were trying to
bring up a cowbunting besides their own
family, and perhaps each thought the
other was to blame for the misfortune.
Indeed it took little imagination to think
that their perpetual squabbles were
caused by mutual recriminations in regard
to their voracious foster nestling.
Poor vireos! They fought with each
other and everyone else, but particularly
with a ph&oelig;be which had a nest near by,
and was also tired and fretful from overwork
and perhaps fond of a row himself,
for he had an aggravating habit of
coming into a little tree just below the
vireos&rsquo; nest and twitching his tail in the
rather inane manner peculiar to ph&oelig;bes,
and that was all that was needed to throw
the vireos into a perfect fume, and they
responded instantly, flying at him wrathfully
and were promptly met by a kindred
spirit. It was a most unreasonable business,
as neither wanted anything that
the other had, and seemed to prove that
all they needed was an excuse to show
their ill temper. These same vireos had
a very real cause for rage and fear in
the presence of the red squirrels, and
they never failed to pursue and scold
one the moment it appeared. Their whole
life seemed so uncomfortable and their
perpetual fussing was so wearisome that
it was difficult to feel proper sympathy
for them when their affairs ended tragically.
But they were most devoted
parents, and as such must have credit,
though their domestic arrangements
seemed squalidly inharmonious and were
so pronounced that no one living in the
vicinity could help knowing all about
them.</p>
<p>Thistle birds, like the vireos, are very
apt to appear in response to any call of
alarm or annoyance from their neighbors,
but their interest seems to have a sweet
and kindly spirit, very different to the
acidulated attitude of the redeyed vireo.
In truth the most marked characteristic
of these little beauties is a peculiar loveableness
and their gentle cheeriness
makes them ideal companions. They
have a delightful habit of appearing in
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
June in flocks and congregating on the
white sandy beach of the lake, reminding
one of the clouds of yellow butterflies
that come to the same place at certain
times of the year. At this time the
male thistle bird sings in a perfect
ecstacy of joy and love; but of all their
attractive qualities none is so endearing
as a habit they have late in the fall of
singing as they fly high up, mere specks,
their exquisite ethereal notes drifting
down sometimes with the first snowflakes
as they go joyfully to meet the storm
and the night.</p>
<p>Scarlet tanagers are often hardly more
agreeable in their marital relations than
the redeyed vireos, and though no doubt
they vary greatly in this respect, those
that I have noticed showed a decided coldness,
occasionally varied by marked crossness.
And the wooing of a scarlet tanager
is sometimes most amusing, for the
female is, or pretends to be, amazingly
indifferent and it must take a courageous
lover to persist in spite of her severe
manner, but male tanagers are gifted with
persistence and do not seem to go unmated,
and they make most devoted
parents, though it would hardly have
been expected of them after their seeming
indifference during the incubating.
One pair of tanagers that had a nest close
to the house, and so could be constantly
watched, were never on really friendly
terms with each other, sometimes quarreling
outright, and only seeking each
other&rsquo;s society when some danger seemed
to threaten their young ones. Then the
female seemed glad of the presence of
her mate. Young scarlet tanagers are
very confiding and gentle in their ways,
and do not seem to have much fear of
man here. There are always several of
these pretty creatures flitting about in
the evergreens near the house at the season
when they are old enough to begin
to take care of themselves, and they often
alight on the hammock ropes or sit on
the branches quite near me, looking on
with bright, interested eyes. They have
little playful ways that are rather unusual
in a young bird and remind one
of kittens. Sometimes when a shred of
the arbor vit&aelig; bark hangs down above
them they will play with it, using their
beak as a kitten does its paws, and their
voices have an almost plaintive sweetness
that adds greatly to their attractions.</p>
<p>Next perhaps in fussiness to a redeyed
vireo may be counted the ph&oelig;be; and
there does not appear to be quite so
much reason for the ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s unhappy
frame of mind, for on the whole their
nests seem rather safer than those of
most birds, built as they so often are in
sheltered places about the houses and
barns. But though the nests escape the
young ph&oelig;bes are very liable to come to
grief, and their elders nearly wear themselves
out when the young first leave the
nest, which they often choose to do on a
very stormy day. Ph&oelig;bes are pugnacious,
too, and carry on feuds among
themselves year after year, those on the
east side of the house always quarreling
with those on the west side, and when
they first come back in the spring there
are frequent conflicts, noisily carried on
in midair, which continue at intervals
until both parties are too busy with their
nests and young to attend to other
things, though even then, if an idle moment
occurs, they promptly take advantage
of it to have a brush with each
other. There never seems to be any particular
advantage gained on either side;
so dismal as they seem about it all they
no doubt rather enjoy the excitement
afforded by these little interludes.</p>
<p>Young ph&oelig;bes show none of these
aggressive qualities, and have the most
gentle and attractive manners and a peculiar
air of innocence that is most captivating.
If the parent ph&oelig;be brings up
an insect all the nestlings, who may be
sitting in a row on a branch, wave their
soft wings and squeak. The parent inspects
them for a moment and then feeds
one. The instant the old bird has decided
which shall be fed the rest subside
and wait quietly until her return. There
is no pushing and crowding or following
the parent.</p>
<p>The slate colored junco is another of
the essentially cheerful spirits, yet has a
remarkable sedateness and self-possession,
such as one is sometimes surprised
to find in people of particularly quiet and
gentle dispositions. And he has one habit
that has made him very dear, for he
always appears in the fall and remains
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
until quite late in the season. During
this time he haunts the evergreen trees
in front of the house, coming back there
every evening to sleep or to seek shelter
from a storm, announcing his arrival
with low twitterings and restless games
of play. If one goes under the evergreens
after dark and gently shakes a
branch there will be a slight fluttering
of wings and disturbed sleepy notes from
the juncos. They love to feed in the
drive which runs in front of the house
and in the thickets of rose bushes that
creep up to the windows, coming close to
the veranda and eating any crumbs that
are thrown out for them, and even on the
wettest day looking trim and contented
and bringing with them a sense of companionship
which can be only appreciated
by those who have lived much alone,
when the different creatures come to be
better known than they can be where
there are people constantly distracting
the attention.</p>
<p>The Kentucky cardinal, though I have
known it but slightly, made a very vivid
impression because of its gentle pensiveness.
I once spent a few months in a
little village in Florida and flocks of
these exquisite creatures appeared from
time to time in our garden and in different
places that we visited. They were
always rather tame, coming near us and
feeding on the ground, uttering plaintive
notes that reminded me of the cedar
bird and which suggested a much smaller
bird. The cardinal&rsquo;s manner had something
so sensitive and touching about it
that it appealed to me at once and made
the lovely strangers as dear as though
they had been known a lifetime. They
were never hurried or excited and I
never heard a cross note or saw the
slightest indication of any friction among
them; but their whole manner was
colored with sadness&mdash;a quiet, unobtrusive
sadness. Even their song was
tinged with it and it was curious
how these brilliant creatures left on the
mind a sense of &ldquo;going quietly&rdquo; and
being subdued, which made them the
greatest contrast to the absurd redwinged
black birds with whom they often shared
the umbrella tree.</p>
<p>Hundreds of other instances of bird
character crowd into the mind, as one
writes, and the air seems again full of
airy creatures each with his or her small
personality standing out from all the rest
in bright contrast, some grave, some gay,
some cross, and others kind, but all
beautiful and full of interest.</p>

<h2 id="c12">THE LOUISIANA WATER-THRUSH.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Seiurus motacilla.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The Louisiana Water-thrush is a
woodland bird with quite an extended
range, which includes all of the eastern
United States west to the plains and
north to Massachusetts, Michigan and
Minnesota. It winters in the region of
the Gulf of Mexico and southward into
South America. This bird seems to be
burdened with long names, for it is also
called the Large-billed Water-thrush and
Large-billed Wagtail Warbler. The last
name is quite appropriate for it, as well
as the other water-thrushes, are warblers
rather than thrushes. The name Wagtail
well describes one of its most striking
characteristics. It is a dignified bird,
and as it moves with stately steps along
the limb of a tree, or a log upon the
ground, the tail moves up and down in
rhythm with its step. It is a shy bird
and its &ldquo;never-ceasing alertness suggests
the watchfulness of the savage.&rdquo; When
discovered and that will not be until it
already knows of the intruder&rsquo;s presence,
it sounds an alarm and quickly flies to
some distant perch where it watches
every movement of the invader, its body
constantly teetering as if with suppressed
excitement.</p>
<p>When seeking a nesting site the
Water-thrush shows a partiality for wild
and favorable localities near a stream of
water, especially &ldquo;where dashing brooks
leap down wooded hillsides.&rdquo; At times,
however, it will select a retired spot on
the wooded banks of a lowland stream
or of a lake. The nest is built in some
secure retreat among the roots of an
overturned tree, in the cavity of an old
log or stump, or in the moss under a
bank. An impenetrable thicket with a
rank growth of ferns and moss, is the
usual desideratum when seeking a place
to locate its home.</p>
<p>The nests are bulky and constructed
with dead leaves, often partly decayed,
which are obtained from the muddy
banks and with the mud still adhering
to them. These, with twigs and rootlets,
are laid together and when the mud
dries all are cemented into a compact
mass which forms the wall of the nest.
This is lined with fine grasses, small
roots, bark fibers and feathers or hair.
The nest is so similar in color to that of
its environment that it is not easily detected.</p>
<p>The Louisiana Water-thrush seldom
utters its interesting song when on the
ground, but from some higher perch or
when flying. Audubon thought its song
was equal to that of the European nightingale;
that its notes were as powerful
and mellow and not infrequently as
varied. Dr. Ridgway says, &ldquo;This may
be true of the ecstatic love-song, heard
on rare occasions, and uttered as the
singer floats in perfect abandon of joy,
with spread tail and fluttering wings, but
it can hardly be true of the ordinary
song, which, although rich, sweet and
penetrating, and almost startling in the
first impression it creates, is soon finished
and the pleasing effect is somewhat
transient. It cannot be denied,
however, that its song is one of the richest
to be heard in our forests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another Writer speaks of its song as
&ldquo;a beautiful, wild, wayward effort,&rdquo; and
Mr. Chapman says, &ldquo;As a songster the
Water-thrush is without a rival. His
song is not to be compared with the
clear-voiced carol of the rose-breasted
grosbeak, the plaintive chant of the field
sparrow, or the hymnlike melody of the
true thrushes; it is of a different kind. It
is the untamable spirit of the bird rendered
in music. There is an almost
fierce wildness in its ringing notes. On
rare occasions he is inspired to voice his
passion in a flight-song, which so far
exceeds his usual performance that even
the memory of it is thrilling.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<h2 id="c13">SOME DOGS.</h2>
<p>When I was a small boy I lived with
my parents in my grandfather&rsquo;s home.
Here was grandfather&rsquo;s large dog Rouse.
He was the constant companion of my
uncle in his work on the farm. His
great desire was to carry something in
his mouth when the team started for
the field. He was often given a singletree,
with which he marched along, showing
evident satisfaction. One day he
concluded to cut across a field instead of
going around the road. The fence was
a high rail one and, burdened with the
weight of the heavy singletree, he could
not jump over. After several vain attempts
he dropped his load, stood looking
up and down the road. Then looking
at the singletree for a moment picked
it up and put it through between the
rails. He then jumped over the fence,
gathered up the singletree and trotted
on.</p>
<p>One thing he absolutely refused to
carry was an iron wedge unless it was
put in a basket. On one occasion this
same uncle lost the lash of the whip he
was using in driving a yoke of oxen.
He had another at the house, but it was
nearly a mile distant. He wrote his
want on a slip of paper and giving it to
Rouse said, &ldquo;Take this to mother.&rdquo; He
was soon scratching at the kitchen door.
When the door was opened he dropped
the note on the floor, was given the whip
lash and hurried away to the field.</p>
<p>A certain dog belonged to a doctor.
He often trotted along under the buggy
when the doctor went to call on his patients.
On one occasion the doctor rode
horseback and hurriedly threw the bridle
rein over a hitching post where the visit
was made. The horse threw up his head,
the bridle rein was freed from the post
and the horse started down the road.
The dog saw the move and started after
him. After some little difficulty he
caught the dangling rein, brought the
horse back to the post and held him
there until the doctor came out.</p>
<p>On another occasion a horse was tied
to a post of the porch at the doctor&rsquo;s
house. He got restless and was soon
standing with fore feet on the porch.
The dog saw it and, catching him by
the tail, pulled until he backed down
and stood on the ground.</p>
<p>There is a big shepherd dog not far
from where I live that watches for the
evening train. As soon as it appears
he runs to a certain place beside the
track, where the mail clerk throws him
a bundle of papers. He never fails to
be at his post or on the way.</p>
<p>A dog who was utilized to run a dog
power churn at last grew tired and resorted
to various schemes to get out of
the work. Just after the churn had been
made ready one day the lady heard the
vigorous bawling of a calf and looking
out she saw the dog trying hard to get
a calf into position to do the churning.
After this it was necessary to tie his dog-ship
the night before if he was to be
used next day.</p>
<p>An Iowa dog who had suffered much
from firecrackers on the Fourth always
disappeared soon after midnight of the
third at the first shot of an anvil or cannon
cracker. He spent the day in the
country far from town and never returned
until the noise had ceased.</p>
<p>A friend who was a photographer had
a large Newfoundland dog who had a
great deal of curiosity about his make-up,
as well as much sense. His face was
always the first to appear at the village
postoffice window when the mail was
opened. The master was an oldtime
photographer when stronger water ammonia
was much used in the preparation
of paper. There was an assistant in the
gallery who liked to tease the dog and
knowing the trait of desiring to investigate
every box or bottle that was opened,
played many tricks on him, but none
of them seemed to cure him or to lessen
this desire until he got a good full whiff
of stronger ammonia, which laid him
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
full length on the floor and made him
less anxious to look into everything with
his nose.</p>
<p>His master had a book for the butcher
and a different one for his account with
the grocer. When meat or groceries
were wanted it was only necessary to
give him a book in which had been written
the articles desired and a basket and
away he went. He knew where to go by
the color of the book. Often in coming
home with meat he was set upon by
other dogs who tried to rob him. One
day a large hound tried several times to
get the meat, but was kept away by very
significant growls. Becoming more determined
he made a final dash, when Newfoundland
set the basket down and no
hound ever got a sounder thrashing.
Then with head and tail held high the
basket was carried home in triumph.</p>

<h2 id="c14">PECULIAR MEXICAN BREAD.</h2>
<p>Among some curios lately brought
from Mexico, is a cake made of the eggs
of water beetles.</p>
<p>This odd sort of edible resembles, outwardly,
a biscuit made of coarse brown
or oatmeal flour. In taste it is not unlike
the same wholesome article of diet.
As a matter of fact, water beetles hold
a high place in the domestic economy of
the poorer natives of Mexico.</p>
<p>Their collection is, therefore, quite an
industry, and one in which the Indians,
particularly, are adepts.</p>
<p>This is the plan of operation: Reeds
are cut and placed along the margins of
lakes and ponds. Soon these reeds are
covered by an incredible number of eggs
so minute that it is necessary to shake
them on a cloth to gather them.</p>
<p>These eggs are then put in bags and
pounded.</p>
<p>The result is a coarse flour, which may
be cooked in a great variety of ways. All
highly nutritious and stimulating. A
vast number of beetles are also collected
and used as food for chickens, but notwithstanding
this immense demand, the
supply suffers no appreciable diminution.</p>

<h2 id="c16">LAPIS LAZULI, AMBER AND MALICHITE.</h2>
<h3 class="generic">LAPIS LAZULI.</h3>
<p>This stone was the sapphire of the
Greeks, Romans and Hebrew Scriptures.
Pliny likened it to the blue
sky adorned with stars. Large
quantities of worked pieces of it
are found in early Egyptian tombs,
and the Chinese have long held it in high
esteem. Marco Polo visited Asiatic
mines of the mineral in 1271 A. D., and
these had doubtless been worked for a
long time previous. Besides its value as
a stone it was in former times used as a
blue pigment, giving the ultramarine
blue. In modern times not only has the
esteem in which the stone is held for ornamental
purposes declined but the mineral
can be artificially made so as to give
the desired blue color for paints and thus
the use of the natural lapis lazuli has
greatly diminished. It is still however
carved to make vases, small dishes,
brooches and ring stones and is used to a
considerable extent for mosaic work.
When, also, pieces of sufficient size and
of a uniform color can be found, large
carved objects may be made which command
a high price.</p>
<p>The stone known as lapis lazuli as it
occurs in nature is not a single mineral
but a mixture of several, among which
are calcite, pyrite and pyroxene. From
these however it is possible to separate a
mineral of uniform composition sometimes
crystallized in dodecahedrons
which is probably the essential ingredient
of the stone. This mineral is known
as lazulite and in composition is a silicate
of soda and alumina with a small
quantity of sodium sulphide. It is by
making a substance of this composition
that the artificial ultramarine is produced.
The artificial is said to be as
good as the natural for a pigment and
can be produced for a three-hundredth
part of the cost. The natural lapis lazuli
has a hardness of 5&frac12; and a specific
gravity about like that of quartz. It is
quite opaque. In color it is blue, varying
from the prized ultramarine to paler,
and at times is of a greenish shade.
It is said the pale colored portions can be
turned darker by heating to a red heat.
When the variety from Chile is heated
in the dark it emits a phosphorescent
green light. The stone in Nature is often
flecked with white calcite. Portions
so affected are not considered as valuable
as the uniform blue. Grains of pyrite
are also usually scattered through the
stone giving the &ldquo;starry&rdquo; effect referred
to by Pliny.</p>
<p>Lapis lazuli usually occurs in limestone
but in connection with granite so
that it seems to be a product of the eruption
of the granite through the limestone.
The lapis lazuli of best quality
comes from Asia, the mines being at
Badakschan in the northeastern part of
Afghanistan on the Oxus river. The
mining is done by building great fires on
the rocks and throwing water on them to
break them. The yield at present is
small, not over 1,500 pounds a year being
obtained. The lapis lazuli from
these mines is distributed all over Asia,
going chiefly to China and Russia. The
price realized is said to be from $50 to
$75 per pound. Lapis lazuli of poorer
quality comes from a region at the
western end of Lake Baikal in Siberia.
The only other important locality is in the
Andes Mts. of Chile near the boundary
of the Argentine Republic. This material
is not much used at the present
time on account of its poor quality but
it was employed by the Incas for decorative
purposes. One mass 24&times;12&times;8 in.,
doubtless from this locality is now in the
Field Columbian Museum, and was found
in a Peruvian grave. It is one of the
largest masses of lapis lazuli known.</p>
<p>The walls of a palace at Zarskoe-Selo,
Russia, built by order of Catherine II
are entirely lined with slabs of lapis
lazuli and amber. Pulverized the stone
was used as a tonic and purgative by the
Greeks and Romans. The name lapis
lazuli means blue stone. Armenian
stone is another term by which the stone
is known in trade.</p>

<h3 class="generic">AMBER.</h3>
<p>Few minerals have been longer in favor
for ornamental purposes than amber.
Among remains of the earliest peoples
such as the Egyptians and Cave-dwellers
of Switzerland it is found in carved
masses indicating that it was highly
prized. The Phenicians are said to have
sailed to the Baltic for the purpose of
procuring it, while the Greeks&rsquo; knowledge
of it is indelibly preserved in our
word electricity derived from their word
elektron. The high favor in which the
ancients regarded amber has hardly endured
however to the present time.
Were it not for its use for mouthpieces
of pipes and other smokers&rsquo; articles and
the occasional amber necklace to be seen,
amber would hardly be known among
the present generation in our country.</p>
<p>Amber is a fossil gum of trees of the
genus Pinus and is thus a vegetable
rather than mineral product. In color
it is yellow, varying to reddish, brownish
and whitish. Its hardness is 2 to 2.5, it
being slightly harder than gypsum and
softer than calcite. It cannot be
scratched by the finger nail but easily
and deeply with a knife. It is also brittle.
Its specific gravity is scarcely
greater than that of water, the exact
specific weight being 1.050-1.096. It
thus almost floats in water, especially
sea water. It is transparent to translucent.
On being heated it becomes soft
at 150 degrees and at 250 degrees to 300
degrees melts. It also burns readily and
at a low temperature, a fact which has
given rise to the name of bernstein by
which the Germans know it, and to one
of the Roman names for it, lapis ardens.
Rubbed with a cloth it becomes strongly
electric, attracting bits of paper, etc. As
already noted, our word electricity comes
from the Greek for amber, this seeming
to be one of the first minerals in which
this property was noted. Amber being a
poor conductor of heat feels warm rather
than cold in the hand, contrary to
most minerals. It is attacked but slowly
by alcohol, ether and similar solvents, a
property by which it may be distinguished
from most modern gums and
some other fossil ones. In composition
it is an oxygenated hydrocarbon, the
percentages of these elements being in
an average sample, carbon 78.94, hydrogen
10.53 and oxygen 10.53. The mineralogical
name of amber is succinite, a
word derived from the Latin succum,
juice. One of its constituents is the organic
acid called succinic acid.</p>
<p>The present source of most of the
amber of commerce is the Prussian
Coast of the Baltic Sea, between Memel
and Dantzig, although it is found as far
west as Schleswig-Holstein and the Frisian
Islands and even occasionally on
the shores of Denmark, Norway and
Sweden. From time immemorial pieces
of amber have been cast upon the shore
in these localities and their collection
and sale has afforded a livelihood to
coast dwellers. Such amber is called sea
stone or sea amber and is superior to
that obtained by mining, since it is
usually of uniform quality and not discolored
and altered on the surface. Owing
to its lightness the amber is often
found entangled in seaweed and the collectors
are accustomed to draw in masses
of seaweed and search them for amber.
Amber so obtained is called scoopstone,
nets being sometimes used to gather in
the seaweed. In the marshy regions
men on horse-back, called amber riders,
follow the outgoing tide and search for
the yellow gum. It is also searched for
by divers to some extent. From the
earliest times the title to this amber has
vested in the State and its collecting has
been done either under State control or
as at present when a tax is levied by the
government upon it. This tax is levied on
the amber that is mined as well as that
obtained from the sea and brings a revenue
at the present time of about $200,000.</p>
<p>Up to 1860 the methods of procuring
amber were largely confined to obtaining
it in the manner above noted. As it
was evident however that the sea amber
came from strata underneath and that if
either by dredging or mining these
strata could be reached a much larger
supply could be obtained, exploration
was carried on by mining methods
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
with successful results, and the principal
amount of the amber of commerce is
now so obtained. The strata as shown
in the mines of Samland, the rectangular
peninsula of East Prussia where most of
the mining is carried on, are: First, a
bed of sand; below this a layer of lignite
with sand and clay, and following
this a stratum of greensand, fifty or sixty
feet in thickness. While all these
strata contain scattered pieces of amber,
it is at the bottom of the greensand layer
that the amber chiefly occurs, in a stratum
four or five feet thick and of very
dark color. It is called the &ldquo;blue earth.&rdquo;
This stratum is of Tertiary age and
there can be no doubt that its amber represents
gum fallen from pines which
grew at this period and whose woody
remains are represented to some extent
in the layer of lignite. It is probably
true as Zaddach remarks that the amber
has been collected here from older deposits.
One of the most interesting
proofs of the vegetable origin of amber
is the occurrence in it of insects, sometimes
with a leg or wing separated a little
distance from the body, showing that
it had struggled to escape. These insects
include spiders, flies, ants and beetles,
while the feather of a bird has even
been found thus preserved. Indeed the
amber deposits have furnished important
contributions to our knowledge of
Tertiary life. Inasmuch as the pieces
bearing such remains are valued more
highly than ordinary amber, unscrupulous
persons have at times found profitable
employment in boring cavities into
pieces of amber, introducing flies or lizards
into them and then filling up the
hole with some modern gum of the same
color. It is said that all amphibious or
water animals seen in amber have been
introduced in this way.</p>
<p>Besides the counterfeiting of the inclusions
of amber there are several substitutes
for the gum itself. These are
chiefly celluloid and glass, the substitution
of the former being dangerous if
used for the embellishment of pipes, on
account of its inflammatory character.
Celluloid can be distinguished from amber
by the fact that when rubbed it does
not become electric and gives off an odor
of camphor instead of the somewhat aromatic
one of amber. It is also quickly
attacked by alcohol or ether, and when
scraped with a knife gives a shaving
rather than a powder as amber does.
Glass can be distinguished by its cold
feeling and greater specific gravity.</p>
<p>Besides these substitutes it has been
found possible by heating and pressing
the scraps of amber not large enough for
carving to make them into a homogeneous
mass which is sometimes sold as
amber and sometimes as amberoid. Amber
is worked to desired shapes by turning
it on lathes or by cutting by hand.
By heating it in linseed oil it becomes
soft so that it can be bent and often all
opaque spots can be made to disappear
by such treatment. The amber which is
most highly prized of any in the world
comes from Sicily. Eight hundred dollars
have been paid for pieces of this no
larger than walnuts, making their value
nearly equal to that of diamonds. The
beauty of the Sicilian amber consists in
the variety of colors which it displays,
blood red and chrysolite green being not
uncommon, and the fact that these often
exhibit a brilliant fluorescence, glowing
within with a light of different color
from the exterior. Chemically the Sicilian
amber is not the same as the Prussian
as it contains less succinic acid and
is somewhat more soluble. In other respects
it is not essentially different. It
occurs chiefly on the eastern and southeastern
coasts being washed up in a
manner very similar to the Prussian
amber.</p>
<p>Amber has been found in several
places in the United States, but there is
little of commercial value. It is mostly
connected with the Cretaceous glauconitic
or green sand deposits of New Jersey,
fragments being frequently found
there. This amber is of yellow color but
not so compact or lustrous as foreign
amber. Amber has also been reported
from the marls of North Carolina, some
of the coal beds of Wyoming and in
connection with lignite in Alaska. In
the latter region the natives are said to
carve it into rude beads.</p>
<p>Amber occurs in small quantities in
several countries of Europe, such as near
Basel in Switzerland, near Paris in
France, and near London in England. It
is also found in many parts of Asia,
these localities being a source of supply
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
to the Asiatic countries such as China
and India. Occasionally amber is obtained
from Mexico which has the beautiful
fluorescence of the Sicilian article,
though the exact locality whence it
comes is not known. Specimens of
carved amber are found among the relics
of the Aztecs and it is probable that they
used it for incense. The early use of
amber by European peoples has already
been referred to. There are references
to it in the most ancient literature and
worked masses of it are found among
human relics of the greatest antiquity.
Up to comparatively modern times it was
an important article of commerce among
widely scattered peoples and had much
to do with bringing about communication
between them. Together with tin
it was one of the chief objects which led
the Romans to penetrate the Gallic regions
to the west and north of the Mediterranean
and Pliny says that &ldquo;it had
been so highly valued as an object of
luxury that a very diminutive human
effigy made of amber had been known
to sell at a higher price than living men,
even in stout and vigorous health.&rdquo; One
of the most elaborate of the Greek myths
is that which accounts for the origin of
amber. It runs in this wise:&mdash;Phaethon,
undertaking to drive the chariot
of his sun god father, Helios, lost control
of his steeds and approaching too
near the earth set it on fire. Jupiter to
stop him launched a thunder-bolt at
Phaethon and he fell dead into the Eridanus.
His sisters lamenting his death
were changed into poplars and their
tears became amber.</p>
<p>In the Odyssey one of Penelope&rsquo;s admirers
gives her an amber necklace, and
Martial compares the fragrance of amber
to the fragrance of a kiss. Milton writes
of amber and Shakespeare mentions it
both in &ldquo;Love&rsquo;s Labor Lost&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Taming of the Shrew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Necklaces of amber are popular wedding
presents among the peasants of
Prussia and they form an important feature
of the ornaments worn by many
African chiefs.</p>
<p>The properties assigned to amber both
as a charm and as a medicine have been
many. From the earliest times it has
been used as an amulet, being supposed
to bring good luck and to protect the
wearer against the evil eye of an enemy.
Necklaces of amber beads are used to
this day as preventive or curative of sore
throat and the Shah of Persia wears
around his neck a cube of amber reported
to have fallen from heaven in the
time of Mohammed, which is supposed
to have the power of rendering its
wearer invulnerable. Amber was also
taken internally in former times as a
cure for asthma, dropsy, toothache and
other diseases and to this day is prescribed
by physicians in France, Germany
and Italy for different ailments.</p>
<p>The use of amber for artistic and decorative
purposes has declined considerably
since the Middle Ages, but magnificent
illustrations of its employment for
these purposes are to be seen in many
European museums, notably the Green
Vaults of Dresden.</p>
<p>Though so soft and easily destructible
a substance it endures with ordinary
care as well as the hardest stone, and
works of art formed from amber are as
well preserved as any to be found.</p>
<h3 class="generic">MALICHITE.</h3>
<p>Malachite is a green opaque mineral
whose color indicates a salt of copper. It
is a carbonate of copper containing water,
the percentages being in the typical mineral,
cupric oxide 71.9, carbon dioxide
19.9, and water 8.2. It is the common
form which copper assumes when it or
even its ores oxidize in the air. Many of
the green stains on rocks or minerals can
be correctly referred to malachite. It is
only valued for ornamental purposes
however when it occurs in compact
masses usually exhibiting concentric layers.
Malachite in this form takes a fine
polish. Malachite is not a hard mineral,
its hardness being between 3.5 and 4. It
can therefore be scratched with a knife.
It is comparatively heavy, weighing four
times as much as an equal bulk of water.
When heated before the blowpipe it fuses
easily, coloring the flame green. By
heating long enough on charcoal it can
be made to yield a globule of copper. It
is easily attacked by common acids, causing
effervescence of carbon dioxide.
This test can be used to distinguish it
from the silicate of copper, chryscolla,
which has the same color.</p>
<p>Besides its occurrence in massive forms
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
as noted above Malachite not uncommonly
occurs in tufts and rosettes incrusting
other minerals. This is an especially
common occurrence in mines in Arizona
and affords specimens of great beauty
especially when the green tufts of malachite
are seen upon brown limonite, for
then the appearance of moss on wood is
closely simulated. Such material is of
course too fragile to be used for decorative
purposes.</p>
<p>Malachite is prepared for ornamental
use by sawing masses of the character
of those previously referred to into thin
strips which are then fastened as a veneer
on vessels of copper, slate or other
stone previously turned to the desired
shape. Putting pieces together so that
neither by their outlines nor color will it
appear that they are patchwork requires
a high degree of skill and such work is
done almost exclusively in Russia. Table
tops, vases and various other vessels
are manufactured in this way and form
objects of great beauty. The pillars of
the Church of Isaac in St. Petersburg
are of malachite prepared in this way
and there are similar pillars in the
Church of St. Sophia, Constantinople,
said to have been taken from the Temple
of Diana at Ephesus.</p>
<p>Occasionally the desired object can
be turned from a single piece of malachite,
but pieces of sufficient size for this
purpose are rare. Bauer describes one
piece found in the Gumeschewsk mines
which was 17&frac12; feet long, 8 feet broad
and 3&frac12; feet high and compact
throughout. This is probably the largest
single mass known.</p>
<p>Russia furnishes most of the malachite
suitable for work of this kind and the
art of cutting and fitting the stone is
possessed almost exclusively in that
country. Most of the Russian malachite
has been obtained from the mines of
Nischne-Tagilsk and Bogoslowsk in the
northern Urals, or Gumeschewsk in the
southern. The supply has gradually decreased
till now only the Nischne-Tagilsk
mines are productive. The malachite
is said to occur there in veins in
limestone.</p>
<p>Besides the Urals, fine malachite suitable
for cutting comes from Australia.
Burra Burra in New South Wales and
Peak Downs in Queensland are localities
whence good Australian malachite
is obtained.</p>
<p>Malachite as a mineral is common in
copper mines in the United States but it
is only in Arizona that it is found of a
quality suitable for cutting. A variety
from Morenci, Arizona, consists of malachite
and azurite and gives a combination
of green and blue that is unique and
pleasing. (See colored plate.) Less
use has been made of such material for
ornamental purposes than might have
been for most of it has unfortunately
been smelted as a copper ore.</p>
<p>Malachite is rarely used for rings or
small jewels but is cut into earrings,
bracelets, inkstands and similar objects.
Art objects of malachite seem to have
been in much favor with Russian emperors
as gifts to contemporaneous sovereigns,
and so bestowed are to be seen
in numerous palaces in Europe. Perhaps
the most famous of these gifts is
the set of center tables, mantel pieces,
ewers, basins and vases presented by the
Emperor Alexander to Napoleon and
still to be seen in an apartment of the
Grand Trianon at Versailles.</p>
<p>Malachite was well known to the ancients
and like other precious stones was
worn as an amulet. It was called pseudo-emerald
by Theophrastus. Its name is
from the Greek malake, the word for mallows
and was given doubtless on account
of its green color.</p>
<p>Azurite, the blue mineral which often
accompanies malachite is likewise a hydrous
carbonate of copper and occasionally
occurs so that it can be used with
malachite for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2 id="c17">THE LEAF BUTTERFLY.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Kallima paralekta</i>.)</span></h2>
<p>There are many instances of protective
imitation or mimicry in nature, but
none are more pronounced, more perfect
or more interesting than that shown by
the leaf butterflies. Briefly defined, the
phenomenon of mimicry is that relation
which obtains when &ldquo;a certain species of
plants or animal possesses some special
means of defense from its enemies and
some other species inhabiting the same
district or a part of it, and not itself
provided with the same special means of
defense, closely resembles the first species
in all external points of form and
color, though often very different in
structure and unrelated in the biological
order.&rdquo; Many animals, such as some
tree-lizards, resemble the colors of the
environment in which they live, either
for protection from enemies or in order
that they may more easily catch their
prey. Some arboreal snakes hang from
the boughs of trees like the drooping
ends of creeping vines.</p>
<p>The coloring of the under surface of
the wings of the leaf butterflies very
closely resembles the color of a dried
leaf. As dried leaves vary in color and
appearance, so do the butterflies vary
in the color and markings of their wings.
It is said that even in the same species,
the under surface of the wings may be of
various shades of brown, yellow, ash
and red. But the imitation of the dried
leaf does not alone rest on the color, for
often, here and there, may be seen small
groups of dark colored spots which
strikingly resemble the patches of fungi
that are so common on leaves. The
mimicry of this butterfly is purely protective
and not for the purpose of deceiving
its prey.</p>
<p>Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace in his
&ldquo;Malay Archipelago&rdquo; writes of this butterfly
as he found it in its native element.
He says, &ldquo;This species was not
uncommon in dry woods and thickets,
and I often endeavored to capture it
without success, for after flying a short
distance it would enter a bush among
dry or dead leaves, and however carefully
I crept up to the spot, I could never
discover it till it would suddenly start
out again, and then disappear in a similar
place. At length I was fortunate
enough to see the exact spot where the
butterfly settled, and though I lost sight
of it for some time, I at length discovered
that it was close before my eyes,
but that in its position of repose it so
closely resembled a dead leaf attached to
a twig as almost certain to deceive the
eye, even when gazing full upon it. I
captured several specimens on the wing,
and was able fully to understand the
way in which this wonderful resemblance
is produced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ends of the upper wings terminate
in a fine point, just as the leaves of
many tropical shrubs and trees are pointed,
while the lower wings are somewhat
more obtuse, and are lengthened out into
a short thick tail. Between these two
points there runs a dark curved line, exactly
representing the midrib of a leaf,
and from this radiate on each side a few
oblique marks, which well imitate the
lateral veins. These marks are more
clearly seen on the outer portion of the
base of the wings and on the inner side
toward the middle and apex, and they
are produced by striae and markings
which are very common in allied species,
but which are here modified and
strengthened so as to imitate more exactly
the venation of a leaf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The habit of the species is always to
rest on a dead twig and among dead or
dried leaves, and in this position, with
the wings closely pressed together, their
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
outline is exactly that of a moderately
sized leaf, slightly curved or shrivelled.
The tail of the hind wing forms a perfect
stalk, and touches the stick while the
insect is supported by the middle pair
of legs, which are not noticed among the
twigs and fibers that surround it. The
head and antennae are drawn back between
the wings, so as to be quite concealed,
and there is a little notch hollowed
out at the very base of the wings,
which allows the head to be retracted
sufficiently. All these varied details
combine to produce a disguise that is so
complete and marvellous as to astonish
everyone who observes it; and the habits
of the insects are such as to utilize all
these peculiarities, and render them
available in such a manner as to remove
all doubt of the purpose of this singular
case of mimicry, which is undoubtedly a
protection to the insect. Its strong,
swift flight is sufficient to save it from
its enemies when on the wing, but if it
were equally conspicuous when at rest, it
could not long escape extinction owing
to the attacks of the insectivorous
birds and reptiles that abound in tropical
forests.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c19">BEAUTIFUL VINES TO BE FOUND IN OUR WILD WOODS.</h2>
<p>As the summer closes and the trees,
flowers and vines have all reached their
greatest perfection, have fulfilled their
mission in life, and in addition have
beautified all the spring and summer our
lawns and verandas, and have been admired
as wonderful children of the florists&rsquo;
skill, how many of us know that
many of them and especially most of
these beautiful vines, could be found in
our wild woods just for the looking?
That we could with our own hands
transplant them to our homes and have
just as beautiful vines on our little
porches and verandas as any millionaire
on our boulevards?</p>
<p>One vine that we see covering our
stateliest mansions and growing over
our most humble little cottage, is common
in all the woods of the United
States from Maine to Florida, from
New York to California, is the Ampelopsis
quinquefolia&mdash;or Virginia creeper&mdash;American
ivy or woodbine&mdash;its
name changing with the portion of the
country you happen to be when you find
it, for we see it frequently under its various
names in cultivation, and it certainly
grows in great abundance and in
the most graceful ways in our woods,
over trees and shrubs and old rock
fences, clinging in the most loving way
to any surface with which it comes in
contact. It belongs to the order Vitace&aelig;
or Vine family, which is a family of
climbing shrubs, and to which all of our
wild grapes belong.</p>
<p>Its name Ampelopsis is from two
Greek words, meaning vine and appearance;
quinquefolia, five leaved or fingered;
its leaves being alternate and
compound, with five leaflets, long and
pointed, radiating from the center. It
may be that it was meant to signify that
our five fingers may handle it recklessly
and not run any risk of poisoning, as so
many people are fearful of being&mdash;they
being unable to distinguish it from the
Rhus radicans or poison ivy&mdash;which belongs
with the sumachs, and has only
three leaflets or divisions in its leaves.
This poison ivy could be so easily exterminated
if every one who finds a plant
of it would dig it up and burn it. It
surely is as much one&rsquo;s duty to help exterminate
a poisonous plant as it is to
cultivate and nourish an ornamental,
beautiful, harmless one. Yet there is
hardly a park in our larger cities where
you will not find the Rhus radicans or
poison ivy growing.</p>
<p>In the Virginia creeper we will find
tendrils growing from the base of its
leaves, that swell at their tips into sucker
like disks, by means of which the plant
clings firmly to walls and trees in its
extensive climbing. The flowers of this
beautiful vine are small, inconspicuous
and greenish in color, with five concave
thick spreading petals, with a calyx
slightly five toothed, a two celled ovary
or seed vessel, each cell containing two
seeds. It blooms early in June and in
the early autumn, when its leaves are
turning the most exquisite shades of
scarlet and crimson, these little flowers
develop into clusters of deep blue or
purple berries about the size of peas.</p>
<p>The whole vine is really more beautiful
in the autumn than it is in the spring,
and it surely does more than its part in
making our American woodlands such
great expanses of gorgeous coloring in
the fall as to attract the attention and

<h2 id="c20">SOME SNAILS OF THE OCEAN.</h2>
<p>The Marine snails outnumber all of
the other mollusks and their shells are
far more beautiful, those in the tropics
having the most gaudy colors imaginable.
The animals are all formed on the
same plan although each family has
some peculiarity not shared by its relatives.
They are found in all parts of
the world, and in all climates. While
the majority of species live either between
tides on near low water, there are
not a few which live in the abysses of the
ocean and have been dredged at a depth
of three thousand fathoms, a distance
of over three miles. The average depth
at which mollusks are found in any number
is about one thousand fathoms. The
variability of marine snails is so great
that only a few typical forms can be
mentioned.</p>
<p>The Limpet or Patella is a familiar
mollusk to many visitors at the sea
shore. This shell is a depressed, conical,
oval disk, looking not unlike a miniature
shield. They live on rocks, to which
they tenaciously cling. Some experiments
which were made on the English
limpet several years ago showed that
they could sustain a weight of thirty
pounds attached to their shell without
being pulled from the rock. The animal
seems to have a pretty clear idea of
local geography, for it invariably returns
to the same place after its excursions
for food and the rock in some localities
has been hollowed out to a considerable
depth by the continuous dwelling
thereon of the limpet. If the surface
of the rock is uneven the shell
grows in such a manner as to fit these
inequalities. While grazing along the
sides of a rock covered with fine sea
weed it will leave a track like a worm
and will clear off quite an area in a very
short space of time. This track is made
by the radula, which is very long and is
thrust out and loaded with food which it
carries to the mouth. When at rest the
radula is coiled like a watch spring. On
the British coast the limpet is used as
an article of food and primitive man
not only ate the mollusks but made a
necklace by stringing the shells together.
There are several hundred species of
limpet-like shells and they are found in
all parts of the world, especially on
rocky shores.</p>
<p>A family of shells closely related to
the limpets is the Fissurellid&aelig;, or keyhole
limpet, distinguished from the last
family by having a slit or foramen in
the apex of the shell, through which the
waste products of digestion are discharged.
This slit resembles a key-hole
and for this reason they are called key-hole
limpets. The shells of Fissurella
are generally rougher than those of Patella
and they live, as a rule, in warmer
seas. In habits the key-hole limpet resembles
the limpet, living in one rocky
place and making excursions for food.
In the young shell the spire is without
a perforation, this appearing as the shell
increases in age. There are over one
hundred species of key-hole limpets, several
handsome species of which inhabit
Florida and the West Indies.</p>
<p>The Haliotis or abalone shells abound
in many parts of the world and are
widely known for their beauty. The
largest and finest shells live on the coast
of California where they attain a length
of ten inches. The shells are flat, though
made in the form of a spiral and are
perforated near the edge of the last
whorl, which is many times the size of
all the rest combined, and through this
perforation the water from the gills, together
with the waste products of the
animal, are poured out. As the shell increases
in size the old holes are filled up
and new ones are formed. The inside
of the shell is resplendent with iridescent
colors, particularly about the region of
the huge muscle scar, and when the outside
is polished they become objects fit
for the palace of a king. A large part
of the mother-of-pearl is furnished by
these shells and a vast number are annually
exported for the purpose of making
pearl buttons. In England they are
called &ldquo;Ormers&rdquo; but the correct name,
if we translate the generic title, is &ldquo;Sea-ear&rdquo;
or ear-shells. To the Chinese the
abalone is an object of great economic
importance and they gather them in
large quantities, dry the animals and use
them as food, principally in the form of
soup, which is said to be very delicious.
The abalone clings to the rocks with
terrible power and many a lonely fisherman
has been drowned while gathering
this mollusk, by getting his fingers
caught between the shell and the rock.</p>

<p>There are three families of shells
which are much sought after by conchologists,
these are the top shells (Trochid&aelig;),
the turban shells (Turbinid&aelig;) and
the pheasant shells (Phasionellid&aelig;).
Altogether they embrace nearly five hundred
species which live from the shore
between tides to the lowest depths of the
ocean. The shells of the top shells vary
to a wonderful degree; some are large,
others small; some are perfectly plain
and smooth while others are ornamented
by impressed lines, ribs and granules,
some are very thin and delicate while
others are large and massive. Many of
the species are richly colored with
brown, purple, black, green and yellowish,
and all are more or less pearly. They
are all vegetable eaters.</p>
<p>One of the best known is Trochus
niloticus, a large, massive shell striped
with brown, which is seen on the mantle
of many households. One of the
prettiest top shells is the ringed top
shell (Calliostoma annulatum) found
abundantly in some parts of California.
The surface is marked by several rows
of delicate points and the suture is bordered
by a rich line of purple. It lives
in the seaweed off shore and may be
seen in pleasant weather crawling about
among the weeds. During storms or
rough weather this frail mollusk sinks
to the bottom of the sea. The top shells
inhabit many parts of the world, the
coasts of Florida and California producing
several very handsome and interesting
species.</p>
<p>The Turban shells include many fine
and large shells, a notable species being
Turbo marmoratus, the &ldquo;green turban&rdquo;
of the dealers. This shell is about seven
inches in diameter, rich green outside
and pearly inside. It is largely used for
mother-of-pearl work and for making
pearl buttons. It is said that the early
Scandinavian monarchs used this shell
as a drinking cup. At the present time
it is used for ornamental purposes, richly
mounted. In Japan the animal is
used for making chop suey, being cut in
little dice-like pieces.</p>
<p>The Pheasant shells are beautifully
variegated with red, black, white and
brown and are very interesting animals
to study alive. When crawling, the left
side of the foot moves forward while the
right remains stationary, and when the
right side moves the left remains stationary.
This curious mode of progression
has been likened to the canter of a
horse. The larger species, with beautifully
variegated shells, inhabit Australia,
while the smaller species live in the Mediterranean
Sea, South Africa, the West
Indies and California.</p>
<p>The Neritas are very abundant in
tropical and semi-tropical countries
where they live on rocks and stones near
low water mark. They are said to be
nocturnal and spend the night feeding
on seaweed. The shell of the Nerita is
solid and heavy and variously ornamented
with ribs, pustules and color patterns.
The &ldquo;bleeding tooth shell&rdquo; (Nerita peloronta),
so named from the presence of
a red spot near one of the columella
teeth, is a typical member of this genus.
A species living in the Philippine Islands
is said to climb trees to a considerable
height.</p>
<p>The family Cerithiidae comprises
some very handsome shells which inhabit
salt, brackish and fresh water.
They are found throughout the world
but the finest species live in the tropics.
The spire is very long and is composed
of many whorls. Some shells are smooth
and polished, while others are marked
by frills, knobs, spines and ribs. The
name Cerithium is from the Greek word
ceration, meaning a small horn, and is
used because of the horn-like shape of
the shell. This family has its giants and
also its pygmies, the latter being pretty,
reticulated shells from one fourth to
three fourths of an inch in length, living
among the eel grass and other vegetation
along the shore. There are over a hundred
species of these small shells, and
some when handled discharge a bright
green fluid.</p>
<p>Whoever visits the seashore is bound
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
to become intimately acquainted with
the Littorinas, or periwinkles, for they
cover the rocky shores everywhere, millions
of their rounded shells clinging to
the rocks when the tide goes out. They
feed on the algae which grows on the
shore. They are found in both brackish
and fresh water. The common periwinkle
(Littorina littorea) is extremely
abundant on the shores of southern Europe
and the northern part of the United
States. In England it is used as an article
of food and it is said that nearly
two thousand tons are gathered annually
and that a thousand persons are employed
in capturing it. In London and
other large cities they are sold on the
street, the animal being picked out with
a pin. It is used for bait in some of the
fisheries and the oystermen plant many
bushels on their oyster beds yearly to
keep the seaweeds from accumulating.
From these facts it will appear that this
periwinkle is of considerable economic
importance. All of the species are amphibious,
living for a long time out of
the water.</p>
<p>Of all the gastropods none excel the
curious Xenophora in point of oddity.
The shell is in general form like that of
the top shell, but as it grows it attaches
to itself small stones and pieces of shell,
so that when the animal is fully grown
it looks like a heap of dead shells and
pebbles. This habit is in all probability
to conceal the animal from its enemies.
They are called &ldquo;carriers&rdquo; and the individuals
with shells attached to their
house are called Conchologists, while
those with stones attached are called
Mineralogists. The fragments of shells
are attached with concave sides upward
so as not to impede the animal during
locomotion. The carriers are not able
to glide like other mollusks, their feet
being very small. They progress by lifting
the front part of the foot to an object
and then drawing the hind part
toward it. In this way they jump or
scramble along in a ludicrous manner.</p>
<p>Related to the &ldquo;carriers&rdquo; are the slipper-shells
(Crepidula), the horse-hoof
shell (Hipponyx) and the bonnet-limpet
(Capulus). The slipper shells are found
in many parts of the world and are particularly
abundant on the Atlantic and
Pacific shores of the United States. The
shell is flat and somewhat limpet-like,
and across one end, near the apex, is a
little shelf which gives it the appearance
of a Chinese slipper. They adhere to
stones, shells, crabs and any submerged
object, and modify the form of their
shell to fit the inequalities of their resting
place. Thus a Crepidula on a Pecten
shell will be ribbed while the same
species on a stone will be perfectly
smooth. Frequently they may be seen
piled one upon another in tiers of six or
more. The animal generally feeds on
seaweed but has been known to eat
other mollusks. The bonnet limpets also
belong to this family, as do the cup-and-saucer
limpets (Calyptraea).</p>
<p>The family Strombidae contains many
large and interesting shells. The animal
is very powerful and is able to leap a
considerable distance. Mr. Arthur
Adams, a celebrated conchologist, thus
describes its method of leaping: &ldquo;Planting
firmly its powerful, narrow operculum
against any resisting surface, it
insinuates it under the edge of its shell
and by a vigorous effort, throwing itself
forwards, carrying its great heavy
shell with it, the animal rolls along in a
series of jumps in a most singular and
grotesque manner.&rdquo; The eyes of the animal
are greatly developed. The shells
of Strombus vary greatly in form and
color. In some the outer lip is simply
turned over while in others it is modified
by little spines or projections. The aperture
is frequently colored pink, purple
or yellowish. The large Strombus gigas
is used in carving cameos, its shell being
made up of several layers of different
colors. It is also ground to powder for
the manufacture of porcelain and in the
West Indies the animal is used as an
article of food.</p>
<p>The Auger or steeple shells, belonging
to the family Terebridae, have long been
objects of interest not only to the naturalist
but to the layman who places
them in his house as ornaments. There
are about two hundred species which are
found in many parts of the world, although
chiefly confined to tropical seas.
The shells are very long and are composed
of many tightly wound whorls,
which are smooth in some species and
longitudinally ribbed in others. They
vary also in color, being yellowish, grayish
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
or brownish, and many species are
spotted with red or white.</p>
<p>A group of handsome mollusks live in
the tropics whose shells have been named
Mitra by the naturalist Lamarck from
their fancied resemblance to the Pope&rsquo;s
miter. The shells are fusiform, very
thick and heavy and beautifully ornamented
with various colors. The surface
of the shells of some species is
smooth, others granulose and not a few
spirally lined and longitudinally ribbed,
while the columella is marked by several
heavy plaits or folds. There are
about two hundred species of this genus,
living in all parts of the world but being
more numerous in tropical regions. The
Philippine Islands seem to be the metropolis
of this mollusk, as of others,
and their shores fairly teem with the
graceful creatures. Some of them live
among the coral reefs, concealing themselves
in holes or among the sea weeds
or under stones. Others live on the
sandy or muddy beaches in which they
bury themselves when the tide recedes.</p>
<p>The earlier naturalists were fond of
applying significant names to the shells
which they described and the Mitras
have received their share. Thus we
have the episcopal miter, having a white
shell with brilliant red spots and flame;
the papal miter, with a brown-spotted
white shell; the pontifical miter, with a
red-spotted shell and a coronated spire,
and lastly the cardinal&rsquo;s miter. These
four species might be called the ecclesiastical
quartette.</p>
<p>The Harp shells, although few in species,
are among the most showy of the
marine snails. The shells are large and
marked by many elevated ribs extending
longitudinally, giving the effect of the
strings on a harp, hence the name of the
genus. The colors are different shades
of brown which form neat festoons of
dark brown lines between the ribs. The
inner lip of the shell is marked by a dark
brown spot and another spot is frequently
developed near the upper part of
the whorl. In one species (Harpa
rosea) the shell is marked by several
rosy spots and tints, and is very beautiful.
The animal of this genus is no less
interesting than the shell, being variegated
with many beautiful colors. The
foot is long, crescent shaped in front and
becomes narrowed to a point behind.
The animal is said to voluntarily break
off a piece of its shell when irritated, as
it is not able to retreat within the shell,
being destitute of an operculum. It is
very active and crawls about with an
easy, graceful motion. Harpa lives only
in the tropics and is found in the Indian
and Pacific Oceans and on the west
coast of America.</p>
<p>The Bubble shells include within their
number many curious and interesting
animals. The typical genus, Bulla, numbers
some fifty species of smooth, globular
shells, frequently mottled like a
bird&rsquo;s egg. The aperture is as long as
the shell and the outer lip is thin and
sharp. The animal is large and fleshy
and partly envelops the shell. The bubble
shells love sandy mud flats in which
they bury themselves or find concealment
under masses of sea weed. Like
many land shells they exude vast quantities
of mucus to moisten their skin when
the tide is out. These animals are carnivorous,
living on bivalves and snails,
which are swallowed whole and reduced
to fragments by the huge, calcareous
gizzard. Not all the mollusks of this
order have true shells. The so-called sea
hares, have large, flabby bodies in which
is lodged a small, oblong, transparent
shell. This animal lives among the sea
weed, feeding upon the weed as well as
upon mollusks and other animals. It
discharges a violet liquid when handled
which caused the ancients to believe that
it was poisonous. The old Greek philosophers
wrote a great deal on this subject,
believing that to even touch the
animal with a stick would cause death.
Though repulsive looking creatures they
are perfectly harmless and are even eaten
raw by the natives of the Friendly and
the Society Islands.</p>

<h2 id="c21">JOIN A SUNRISE CLUB.</h2>
<p>Join a sunrise club? as is proposed in
<span class="sc">Birds and Nature</span> for January. Of
course I will. I have for years belonged
to one of two members&mdash;my daughter
and myself. Now we will transfer our
membership to the new club that is to
have members all over the country.</p>
<p>Some of our winter sunsets here in
Nebraska are glorious. I am especially
fond of looking at them through the
thousand interlaced branches of the leafless
trees. One can study tree forms and
sunsets in the same picture. I wonder
that every person is not a sunset observer.
But some people are sunset
blind, and some rarely ever look at the
heavens on starry nights. I sometimes
meet people who lament the fact that
they cannot go to Colorado and see the
mountains, of which they hear such
glowing accounts. I tell them that I do
not pity them at all so long as they do
not care to gaze upon the most glorious
sight which mortal man is permitted to
see&mdash;the starry heavens. They who do
not appreciate the stars and the sunsets
would soon tire of the mountains.</p>
<p>Our summer sunsets are also glorious,
but I miss some of them on account of
the trees around my house. I sometimes
get on my wheel and go out of town
simply to see the sunset. Trees are
nice, but they often hide from us something
nicer. When the towns of Colorado
were new, twenty-five years ago,
we could see the mountains from all our
west doors and windows. Now in those
same towns the people must go out into
the street, or even out of town, if they
would see the mountains in summer.</p>
<p>But, say, let us have another club&mdash;a
Sunrise Club. It may be asking too
much to make it operative for the whole
year, so we will call it a sunrise club for
May and June. Those are the bird
months of the year, the months when
some of us are out before sunrise morning
after morning, to watch the birds
and to hear their wonderful concerts.
Some of the pleasantest memories of my
life are of early morning trips on my
wheel to a certain grove in the edge of
town. On those trips I have seen many
a new bird&mdash;new to me&mdash;and many a
glorious sunrise.</p>
<p>Somehow birds and the rising of the
sun fit into each other beautifully.</p>
<p>There is something inspiring and exhilarating
about sunrise that is not
found in sunsets. The air is more free
from dust; one&rsquo;s body and mind, yes,
and soul, too, are in better mood to enjoy
the sight; one is more pleased to welcome
the sun than to bid him good
night; the birds seem to think so and
they give joyous welcome to the orb of
day; all nature is awakening; a great
thing is happening; a new day, fresh
from the hands of its Maker, is being
born. All hail, thou new creation! Welcome,
thou glorious orb of day! Let
me join with the birds in singing thy
praise. Thou dost flood my soul with
joy even as thou dost flood the earth
with light. Yes, let us have a sunrise
club for May and June, except perhaps
the cloudy and stormy mornings when
even the birds seem to lie abed. Who
will join?</p>

<br />(Lycopersicum esculentum).</p></div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<h2 id="c22">THE TOMATO.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Lycopersicum esculentum.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The tomato is an herbaceous plant, belonging
to the nightshade family (Solanaceae),
the same family to which the
potato and tobacco belong. It has numerous
rather large, showy, cut leaves, which
are more or less woolly, due to numerous
hair cells or trichomes. It has numerous
not attractive or pleasant smelling flowers,
with numerous yellow or red berries,
which vary in size and form. It is a native
of South America, but is very extensively
cultivated in nearly all countries
excepting the cold northern regions. In
1596 it was introduced into England as
an ornamental and medicinal plant. Previous
to about 1840 it was little used in
the United States, but now it is very extensively
grown in green houses, gardens
and as a farm crop. For an early crop
the seed is planted in a hot bed, so that
the plants may be of suitable size for
transplanting as soon as the danger of
frost is past. The plants are placed three
or four feet apart in fairly rich soil
and the soil frequently tilled and kept
free from weeds. The plants grow about
three or four feet high, become quite
spreading and rank so that it is desirable
to tie the top portions to stakes driven
into the ground to keep the plants upright;
this procedure is also of advantage
in ripening the fruit.</p>
<p>Botanically, the fruit is a berry, and
before ripening is of a bright green color,
changing to red in the red variety and to
yellow in the yellow variety. The same
plant bears flowers and ripe fruits, so that
fruits may be gathered for a considerable
period.</p>
<p>Tomatoes have a peculiar flavor and
somewhat acid taste when ripe. The
pulp contains many seeds. As with other
garden plants, there are numerous culture
varieties. Some are no larger than cherries.
Some are pear-shaped; others large
and flattened at the ends. Some are
nearly spherical, others quite irregular.
The ripe fruits must be gathered promptly,
as they decay very readily and quickly.</p>
<p>At the present time the tomato is very
little used medicinally, but is very extensively
used as an article of diet.
Picked green they are pickled either
alone or mixed with other vegetables.
The ripened fruit is prepared in a multitude
of ways. Peeled and sliced raw,
adding salt, pepper, vinegar and sugar.
Boiled in soups, mixed with sauces,
baked or fried entire, fried or baked,
mashed, mixed with stale bread and seasoned,
etc. There is a popular superstition
that eating tomatoes to excess causes
cancer. Tomato preserves are highly
relished by some; likewise tomato pies.</p>
<p>The general opinion prevails among
scientists, as well as laymen, that the
tomato is nourishing and wholesome. It
is certainly harmless when ripe, but the
green pickled preparations are not nourishing
nor particularly wholesome. The
notion that pickles aid digestion is a
mistaken one. The spices added may
stimulate, but the green fruit particles are
not digestible.</p>
<p>The word tomato is of American Indian
origin. The popular name love apples
(German Liebes&aelig;pfel) is a translation
of the French pomme d&rsquo;amour,
which is a corruption of pomo dei Mori,
a name derived from Morocco. The Germans
also designate them apples of Paradise
(Paradies&aelig;pfel).</p>
<p>The entire plant, including flowers and
green fruit, have a somewhat heavy, disagreeable
odor, a characteristic common
to many members of the nightshade family.</p>
